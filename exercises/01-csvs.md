# Using Copilot to Evaluate Your CSV, Or Not

You can use Copilot to figure out details about your CSV file, things such as:

 - What are the headers/columns?
 - How many rows?
 - Is it formatted correctly?

## Akamai Cuz

You can use Copilot to do this, or you can have it generate scripts. Here are some prompt ideas:

```
Create a bash script to count the rows in this CSV
Create a bash script to extract the headers
Is this CSV file a valid CSV?
```

## Going Further

You can turn a CSV into a database (or other formats) easily using Copilot. Use your inspiration!

Some prompts to help...

```
Create a SQLite schema based on the headers in the CSV
Create a SQLite script with data and schema for the CSV
```

Is there a better way to do this?
